     "Description": "Description: Coal and Lignite are important fossil fuel, used for electric power generation,besides use in the boiler of industries. They are the most demanded energy sources andtheir consumption has been increasing. However, there is a need to improve coalcombustion performance to enhance the efficiency of the furnace and boiler. Addition ofadditives to both the fuels is an option and has led to focus by researchers for developingan additive. Such additives can effectively improve the combustion performance of the coaland lignite. A study on the subject would contribute to providing information about the impactof additives on combustion properties, calorific value and a hybrid technology that may useadditives to modify the coal\/lignite surface. Thus, the objective of this study is to relate theeffect of additives on utilization and combustion performances of both the fuels. Improvedefficiency and reduced emissions from of coal\/lignite power stations may lead todevelopment of present and future efficient coal\/lignite combustion technologies. Upgradingcoal, reducing emission of NOx, S02 and particulate matter, and corrosion are some of thefactors in the development of efficient coal technologies. Such additive could be a finelymilled 2 multi-oxide\/carbonate additives when mixed with the coal\/lignite without the needto change the boiler installation has proven to increase the boiler efficiency, flametemperature with reduction in corrosion, NOx and particulate matter (dust) emissions. Theprocess may be developed through bench, pilot and full scale. It would be tested at lab scaleand in actual operation.Skill sets: Instrumentation\/Chemical AnalysisExpected learning: Understanding of Combustion Properties, Additive Development andapplicationSpecific courses required for project execution: Chemical Engineering\/ MaterialsScience &amp; Engineering \/Chemistry,Description: The traditional approach in carrying out mineral exploration studies includedcollection of samples including from drill cores and analyzing them in the laboratory togenerate data. This used to be costly, time consuming, and laborious for mine areas withdifficult terrain. With the advent of latest technologies; especially field portable analyticalinstruments viz. portable visible and near-infrared spectrophotometers, gamma-rayspectrometer, LED fluorimeter, pXRF, pXRD, pLIBS, and µRaman spectrometer; their on-site use has increased in mineral exploration. Furthermore, use of these instruments on sitedo help in quick, real-time, non-destructive, and cost-effective identification, anddetermination of indicator minerals and pathfinder elements in rock and its ore, in soilsediment, and in water samples. Such portable analytical instruments determine accuratechemical and mineralogical data during the field visits with virtually no or minimumlaboratory analysis, thus bypassing the need for sample collection. The information soobtained helps in decision making in carrying out field work as also during drilling operationsin mineral exploration. In our research use of such portable devices would be made incarrying out exploration studies for Gold (Au), Silver (Ag), Rubidium (Rb), Hafnium (Hf),Zirconium (Zr), and a group of 17 Rare Earth Elements (REE) in Ambaji mines.Skill sets: Instrumentation\/Chemical AnalysisExpected learning:a. It would help identify the indicator minerals and path finder elements, making themining activity more focused.b. It would promote sustainable mining including underground mining.c. It would promote collaboration with the technology providers across the world.d.

     "Description": "Description: In the push for a net-zero future, carbon credits play a pivotal role. However, their adoption (both as buyers as well as suppliers of carbon credits) among SMEs remains limited due to high costs, lack of awareness, and uncertainty about long-term benefits. The challenge for this project is to assess the economic feasibility and barriers SMEs face in adopting carbon credits. Students are expected to conduct primary and secondary research, including market analyses, cost-benefit evaluations, and interviews with SME stakeholders. The study should aim to quantify the financial benefits versus the operational costs involved in participating in carbon markets. It should also explore alternative financing solutions, such as climate funds or government subsidies that could make carbon credits more accessible to SMEs. Finally, the project should recommend strategies for better SME participation, focusing on policy interventions, capacity-building initiatives, and collaborations with organizations like RenewCred that offer tech-driven solutions to simplify carbon credit management. The outcome should provide a comprehensive roadmap for SMEs to integrate carbon credits into their sustainability strategies while remaining economically viable.Skill sets: Market research, financial modeling, cost-benefit analysis, policy analysis, stakeholder interviews.&nbsp;Expected learning: Understanding SME challenges in carbon credit adoption, financial impact assessment, alternative financing solutions.Specific courses required for project execution:&nbsp; Any engineering, Sustainable Finance, Carbon Markets and Economics, Business Policy for Sustainability, Data Analytics for Business.,Description: With increasing concerns about greenwashing and the credibility of carbon credits, there is a growing need for a standardized rating framework that evaluates carbon credits not only based on their environmental impact but also their financial viability. RenewCred is uniquely positioned to address this issue by combining advanced technology with scientific rigor. For this project, students are tasked with developing a rating framework for carbon credits that incorporates both environmental and financial metrics. The environmental aspect should assess the quality of the projects generating the credits, including additionality, permanence, and leakage. On the financial side, students should evaluate how carbon credits can be leveraged for green financing, focusing on their impact on corporate sustainability ratings and investor confidence. The framework should also be adaptable for different sectors, such as energy, transportation, and manufacturing. By the end of the project, students should propose a robust, scalable rating system that could be adopted by both investors and regulators to improve transparency and trust in the carbon market.Skill sets: Financial analysis, ESG reporting, carbon credit assessment, risk evaluation, sustainability metrics.Expected learning: How carbon credits are valued, integrating environmental &amp; financial factors in ratings, investor perceptions.Specific courses required for project execution: Any engineering, ESG Investing, Risk Management in Climate Finance, Corporate Sustainability &amp; Reporting, Financial Valuation Techniques.,Description: As environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria become more critical in investment decisions, companies are increasingly turning to carbon credits to enhance their ESG scores. However, the actual impact of carbon credits on corporate ESG performance and investor behavior remains underexplored. This project aims to analyze how carbon credits influence ESG ratings and whether they genuinely affect investor decision-making. Students will need to review existing literature and case studies of companies that have used carbon credits to improve their ESG profiles. They should also conduct interviews with ESG rating agencies, corporate sustainability officers, and institutional investors to gain insights into how carbon credits are perceived within the investment community. The final analysis should present a clear link between carbon credit adoption, ESG scores, and investor interest, with specific recommendations on how companies can better integrate carbon credits into their sustainability reporting to attract investors.Skill sets: ESG analysis, investor behavior study, corporate sustainability reporting, impact assessment.Expected learning: How carbon credits influence ESG scores, investor interest in sustainable finance, corporate climate strategies.Specific courses required for project execution: Any engineering, Corporate Sustainability &amp; ESG, Sustainable Investment Strategies, Impact Assessment in Business, Financial Decision-Making"

     "Description": "Description: As corporations, institutional investors, and high-net-worth individuals increasingly look for ways to reduce their carbon footprints, voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) provide a promising avenue. However, understanding the optimal strategy for entering and navigating these markets remains a challenge for many buyers. The objective of this project is to identify effective investment strategies for buyers in VCMs, focusing on risk management, portfolio diversification, and maximizing both financial and environmental returns. Students will conduct market research to analyze the current trends in voluntary carbon markets, comparing successful case studies of companies and investors that have effectively used VCMs to meet sustainability goals. The project will also assess the types of carbon credits (e.g., avoidance, reduction, or removal) and sectors (e.g., renewable energy, reforestation, or clean transportation) that offer the highest return on investment. Finally, the project should provide a comprehensive decision-making framework for buyers, outlining the key considerations such as credit quality, price volatility, regulatory risks, and co-benefits like ESG improvements. The final deliverable should include specific recommendations for different types of buyers based on their risk appetite and long-term sustainability goals.Skill sets: Market analysis, portfolio management, risk assessment, financial modeling, policy interpretation.Expected learning: How to navigate VCMs, assessing carbon credit quality, optimizing returns while reducing risk.Specific courses required for project execution: Any engineering, Voluntary Carbon Markets, Sustainable Investment &amp; Portfolio Management, Climate Risk Assessment, Financial Derivatives.&nbsp;"
